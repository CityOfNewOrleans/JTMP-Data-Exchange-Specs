# Booking Exchange

The Jail Management System will publish a Booking and Release message each time a client is either booked  into the jail or released for any reason (ROR, Bond, No Probable Cause, Disposition, etc.)

## Preceding Exchange: 

Arrest Report (from Police Department)â€‹

## Triggering Events:

1. Supervisor Approval in JMS of a new Booking
2. Supervisor Approval in JMS of a JMS Release

## Real-World Effects: 

Notify Subscriber systems of a new jail event. Subscribers may update existing pending case events or update previously-created events. Many Subscriber systems will opt to stage incoming events in a queue or review screen pending human action to import into the case management system.
