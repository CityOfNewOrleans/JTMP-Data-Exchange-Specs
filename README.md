<h2>Integration Architecture Overview</h2>
<p>Developers who provide these systems will interact with application programming interfaces (APIs) that JTMP will expose via Azure’s API Gateway. ​JTMP will follow a Publish/Subscribe model for the most part. ​A system or application sending data to shared with partner agencies/systems will call an API to Publish a message. ​The message metadata will indicate which Data Exchange is published in the message body. ​(Not yet available) The Service Bus will call an API hosted at the Subscriber’s system to deliver Subscribed messages. ​Alternatively, Subscribers may call a Polling Message API to Get pending messages. ​These interactions are illustrated below. However, this functionality is still under development. <br>
The following diagram provides an overview of the JTMP Service Bus. ​</p>

<h2>Data Exchange Specifications </h2>
<p>JTMP has identified the Priority Data Exchanges between these systems that drive us toward that vision:</p>
