# Arrest Report

Law Enforcement's Records Management System (RMS) will publish an Arrest Report message each time an officer completes and a supervisor approves an Arrest Report within the system.

**![ArrestReport IEPD](https://github.com/CityOfNewOrleans/JTMP-Data-Exchange-Specs/tree/main/schemas/ArrestReport_iepd/api/xml_schema)**

## Preceding Exchange: 

None at this time. 

## Triggering Events:

1. Approval of a new Arrest Report in the police department Records Management System (RMS)
2. The RMS may utilize a scheduled job that runs on a short time interval to trigger, build and process outbound messages. However, this interval must be short enough that Arrest data will be communicated to the JMS within a reasonable time period that the subject may be booked into jail in a meeting with the Sheriff's Office expectations on processing time. 

## Real-World Effects: 

The purpose of this data exchange is to communicate arrest information to the justice process partners responsible for taking the next steps in criminal case processing. Specifically, the local jail will have informaiton it needs to create a new Booking. And the prosecutor's office will have information it needs to populate a new pre-filing Matter (or Case) and prepare for First Appearance. 

## Data Requirements:
It is critical that Law Enforcement share all relevant identifiers of persons, charges, reports and events to enable justice systems to effectively coordinate and accurately and efficiently build on the information captured at the initial encounter with the arrestee. 

This data exchange should also include all informaiton an arresting officer has, that is relevant to either of the justice partners' information needs described above. 

### Key Arrest data elements include:
- Incident Report Number, generated by the RMS, to uniquely identify the incident and subsequent arrest. New Orleans Police Department has historically called this an Item Number, although the forthcoming RMS system may use more generally-used terms such as Incident Number or Offense Report Number. 
- Charge data that conveys Charge Statute and Description as defined in the City of New Orleans' uniform charge table (UCT). Go to (https://github.com/CityOfNewOrleans/JTMP-Data-Exchange-Specs/blob/main/ChargeCodeUpdateExchange.md for details)</h>
- Person ID number - this could be the internal Master Name Index identifier that the RMS assigns to Person records. 
- State ID (SID) number, if available. This is the state AFIS identifying number tied to a unique set of fingerprints. This number should be associated with an individual over the course of a lifetime, potentially multiple booking events in Orleans Parish and other jurisdictions. NOTE: this number would only be available in RMS for individuals who have previously been booked and fingerprinted in Louisiana, and for whom that number was available to law enforcement previously.
