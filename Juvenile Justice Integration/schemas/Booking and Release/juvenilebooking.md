# Bookings and Releases

The Juvenile Justice Intervention Center (JJIC)'s Jail Management System (JMS) will publish a Booking and Release message each time a youth is either booked  into the jail or released for any reason (Referral, No Probable Cause, Disposition, etc.).

Booking and Release are distinct MessageTypes when making an API call to publish a Juvenile JMS transaction. However both will use the same XML schema to format the payload of the message. 

## Preceding Exchange: 

For Booking: Case Initiation (from Orleans Juvenile Court-OJC)â€‹
For Release: Release Order, Referall, Deferment, Disposition Order, or other Court action authorizing a release from custody. 

## Triggering Events:

1. Orleans Juvenile Court Intake or judicial official makes a decision to refer to JJIC to Detain. 
2. Supervisor Approval in eSupersion of a Release

## Real-World Effects: 

The purpose of this data exchange is to notify Subscriber systems of a new JJIC event. On a new booking, subscribers will have the detention details that can be added to an existing case and/or person record. Subscribers may use a Release message to update Custody Status in their system. 

Subscribers may create new pending case events or update previously-created events. 

### Determining Court of Jurisdiction
The jail will set a "CourtTYpe" value for each charge. This is the jail staff's understanding of the court that will have jurisdiction. It is functinoally the equivalent of the legacy AS400 system creating and "Arrest Register Number" for each set of charges, destined for a specific court. 

The values for CourtType follow a national standard. Our implementation uses the following values:

|CourtType value from the XML|	Court of Jurisdiction-commonly-used agency name|	Commonly-Used Abbreviation
|-------|-----|--------|
|CRI|	Criminal District Court|	CDC|
|MUN|	Municipal and Traffic Court of New Orleans|	MCTNO|
|TRA|	Municipal and Traffic Court of New Orleans|	MCTNO|
|JUV|	Juvenile Court , or Orleans Juvenile Court|	OJC|

## Data Requirements:

### Key Booking data elements include:
- Booking (or Arrest) Number, generated by the JMS, to uniquely identify the arrest event
- Person ID number - a person ID or master name index number generated by the JMS as its internal unique ID
- State ID (SID) number, if available. In adult criminal cases, this is the state AFIS identifying number tied to a unique set of fingerprints. This number should be associated with an individual over the course of a lifetime, potentially multiple booking events in Orleans Parish and other jurisdictions.
- Indicate the <b>Court</b> of Jurisdiction for <b>each Charge</b>. The CourtType element will cdefault to JUV (Orleans Parish Juvenile Court). If a youth is waived but detained at JJIC, CourtType would be CRI, indicating Criminal District Court (CDC).
- Juvenile bookings may also include informaiton about parents/guardians, education level and school attended. 

### Key Release data elements include:
- Person ID
- State ID (SID) if applicable
- Court Case ID. Return the court case number value that was provided in a Case Initiation message from the Court CMS
- Release Date
- Release Time
- Release Reason
- Bond Paid
